* Let the pioneers take the arrows.

* Allow me to shed light on the matter ...

* This document comes without warranty of any kind!

* I do not issue any guarantee that this will work for you!

* I never met one made me want to give up all the others.

* I feel much more at home in Emacs.

* Netstat is my first line of defense against intruders.

* So you are leaving the door open?

* To me, the GPL really boils down to "I give out the code, I want you to do
  the same."

* We believe this price is worth paying.

* The remainder of this paper is structured as follows:

* Above all else, be sure not to let time completely get away from you.

* Be warned.

* If you tell the list which package this is, then we shall not have to look at
  our crystal balls...

* Indeed, it's become something of a joke that the only things you can't avoid
  in life are death, taxes and Ubuntu reviews.

* You never get a second chance to make a first impression.

* Ubuntu deserves 9 stars on a scale of 10.

* Go check if other people have done that already so that you don't have to
  reinvent the wheel.

* Tough luck, but shit happens.

* This is not rocket science, use your mind :)

* If we can't measure it, it doesn't exist.

* I never met one made me want to give up all the others.

* Your true value depends entirely on what you are compared with.

* Three factors decide your worth:

    the need for your work; your ability to do the job; the difficulty of
    replacing you.

* Amarok can play anything, and it's rock solid.

* Installing Xen on Fedora core 6 is like taking candy from a baby.

* Xen remains a relatively immature product today, however, and not one to be
  used by those faint of heart.

* Installation on a remote host is not for the faint of heart.

* The default Ubuntu wallpaper, Lagoon, is a love-it-or-hate-it affair.

* Theory is nice, but how about the real world?

* This is the last resort if something goes wrong.

* You really don't get it, do you?

* If you get technical, you better do it correctly ;)

* This guide will walk you through installing and configuring everything
  you need for sending and receiving email.

* I do not fly the Ubuntu flag in my front yard.

* How I would regard this? As totally, utterly, and terminally stupid,
  of course!

* Now I don't mean to speak evil of Ubuntu :-)

* I visited various RPM distributions, including Red Hat, Mandrake, and
  SUSE, flirted with Gentoo, and jumped on the Ubuntu bandwagon, but I
  could never find a single place to settle -- until I tried Arch Linux.

* I think you hit the nail on the head.

* In many instances, it really beats the pants off bash's Ctrl-r.

* If you're not afraid of getting your hands dirty with the command line.

* Please watch cartoons to increase your mental state.

* Geeks are the ones, that make nerds look bad. Geeks are not only ugly,
  but they are morons too. They lack hygiene, they never dated a girl,
  they wear glasses and suspenders, they study some very boring stuff
  with computers and one day, they are rich mother****ers with model
  girlfriends and a yacht.

* Sorry, my brain was apparently not fully engaged when I wrote that.

* Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.

* I made up in my mind that warnings should be cured at all times, not
  ignored/suppressed.

* Okay...newbie eats crow.

* So? I don't give a rat's ass.

* Did you just flip me off?

* You just flipped me the bird.

* Don't flip me off, you son of a bitch.

* He opens the door, turns around and gives Cartman the finger.

* ...Oh Lord, Kumbaya.

* Hey, who's droppin' bombs in there?! How about a courtesy flush?!

* That's über-cool

* We sense a soul in search of answers.

* Shade and sweet water (dig in, you will find something good)

* THOU SHALT TURN OFF THY CELL PHONE.

* Dump that zero and get yourself a hero.

* Paravirtualization is a $10 word that means it gives the VM access to some
  system devices with virtual devices.

* Early to bed, early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.

* By attacking from the bottom, where Microsoft can no longer successfully
  compete, Linux will finally cut itself a large slice of the desktop market
  pie.

* Unfortunately, most hunger relief programs are simply tax reduction scams.
  People donate millions of dollars to these 'aid' agencies, who spend 99% on
  salaries and other fancy stuff, and then deliver a few thousand tons of
  maize to some harbour in Africa, where it gets dumped on the dock to rot and
  get eaten by rats.

* Thanks for the nudge.

* Please note that this article will focus on the user-visible side of the
  fence; I am a user, not a developer. Please take this into account.

* You get a resounding "YES" from me.

* Unsurprisingly, the reaction of distributions was a mixed bag.

* Sometimes the best way to get to know something is just to stick your hands
  under the hood and get 'em dirty -- with a little guidance, of course.

* I was banging my head against the wall trying to figure out why my passive
  connections were hanging.

* For Your Information

* There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch

* (if memory doesn't fail me ;))

* Here are a few things that I remember off the top of my head:
