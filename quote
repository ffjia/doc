* If privacy is outlawed, only outlaws will have privacy.

                                        - Phil Zimmermann

* Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is
  that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness
  that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, Who am I to be brilliant,
  gorgeous, talented, fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? You are
  a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is
  nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel
  insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We
  were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is
  not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own light
  shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
  As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically
  liberates others.

                                        - Harper Collins, 1992
