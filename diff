    The --- line shows the name of the first file, which has the original
    inventory list. The +++ line shows the name of the second file, which
    contains the updated inventory list.

    The @@ line is called the header, and the section below the header is
    called the hunk. The hunk shows the actual changes between the two files. A
    large diff file will have several hunks, each with a unique header.

    In the hunk, the lines that are not preceded by - and + symbols are the
    context lines. Lines starting with - indicate a line that was in the
    original file but not in the new file. Conversely, lines starting with +
    indicate a line that is in the new file but not in the original file. In
    our example, -1 ball means that the line was present in the original file
    but absent from the new file. The line +3 balls indicates a line was not in
    the original file.


    # To determine whether two files differ
    $ diff -q <FOO> <BAR>
    
    $ diff -Naur <FILE1> <FILE2> > difffile

    # Keep a copy of the original file
    $ patch -b [FOO] < <PATCHFILE>

    # Displays the results of applying the patch without actually changing the file
    $ patch --dry-run [FOO] < <PATCHFILE>
