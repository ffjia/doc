A quick reference
=================

1. Download the debian installer image (the last one stable netinst,
   actually d-i rc2).

2. Install it in a prototype system, and add all the programs you want
   to include on the cd. 

3. Copy all the contents of the cd to your hard-disk.

4. Now you have to syncronize your /var/cache/apt/archives with the
   pool/ of the cd. I've used apt-move for this task:
    
    $ apt-move fsck && apt-move update

5. At this step you have a pool/ with all the packages you want, you
   have to generate your "packages" and "releases" files, it's pretty
   well documented at the wiki.

6. Now copy the folder backup/dist/sarge/main/intaller-i386/ to the
   dist/sarge/main/installer/. The folder backup it's created
   automatically when you run "apt-move fsck".

7. Now, you have to install debian-cd and...

    - go to /usr/share/debian-cd/
    - edit CONF.sh
    - load to the envairoment the variables: ". CONF.sh"
    - make distclean (it cleans your temporal directory)
    - make mirrorcheck (it checks that dependencies of your mirror is
      ok)
    - make status (it should write nothing in your screen)
    - make make bin-list TASK=tasks/yourtask COMPLETE=1 (your task is a
      file which list all the programs you want to include on your cd)
    - make bootable
    - make bin-images


Apt-move
========

    The apt-move move can cache of Debian packages into a mirror
    hierarchy. It will help you build your own local mirror. Running
    apt-move periodically will assist in managing the resulting par‐tial
    mirror by (optionally) removing obsolete  packages  and  creating
    valid local Packages.gz and Sources.gz.

    $ apt-move [-c CONFFILE] [-d DIST] [-afqt] <COMMAND>

    # Builds new local versions of Packages.gz and Sources.gz files.

        $ apt-move packages

    # Preferred method for moving package files from your cache into a
    # local mirror. Equivalent to ’get move delete packages’.

        $ apt-move update

    # Mirror the whole remote site to local (pretty large).

        $ sudo apt-move mirror

    # Only gets the packages that are currently installed on your
    # system.

        $ sudo apt-move sync


Apt-ftparchive
==============

    The apt-ftparchive is the command line tool that generates the
    index files that APT uses to access a distribution source. The index
    files should be generated on the origin site based on the content of
    that site.

    $ sudo apt-ftparchive -c <APT.CONF> generate <DEB.CONFIG>


Overrides files
===============

    1. Get overrides.<dist>.'' files 

        http://<mirror>/debian/indices

    2. Make indices/ in the root dir of Debian CD

        $ mkdir indices/

    3. Copy overrides.<dist>.'' files to indices/ and unzip them

        $ gzip -d overrides.<dist>.''.gz
