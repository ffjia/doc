Basics
======

* Minimal Debian packages: udebs

    - Normal Debian packages (technically)
    
    - Not policy compliant
    
        + No documentation and copyright ﬁles
        
        + File ending .udeb
        
        + Reduced to minimal size
    
    - Types of udebs

        1. Perform an installation step

             * Provide a menu item (Choose language, Install the base
               system, ...)

             * Postinst script to p erform actions

        2. Contain support ﬁles

             * Kernel modules

             * Programs (discover, busybox, ...)

             * Libraries (full lib c, libparted, ...)


* Cdebconf

    - D-i runs at a given priority (normally at high).
    
    - Questions below the current priority are not shown (default
      answer).


* D-I images

    - Directory installer/build in SVN
    
    - Build system based on make
    
    - Only builds initrds and kernel image
    
    - Run make without target to list useful targets


* ISO image

    - Netinst image:        all udebs and base system debs
    
    - Businesscard image:       only udebs, downloads base system from mirror
    
    - sid d-i:      udebs from sid, base system from Sarge
    
    - sarge d-i:        udebs and base system debs from Sarge
    
    - daily:        currently symlink to sarge d-i


* The build directory
    
    - 'sources.list.udeb' is used to configure apt to download udebs
      from a mirror.
    
    - If you have some udebs that are not available on your mirror yet,
      you can drop them in 'localudebs/' and they will be used.


* Where is the log?

    Error messages are redirected to the third console. These messages
    can also be found in /var/log/messages. After installation, this log
    is copied to /var/log/installer/messages on your new system.  
    
    Other installation messages may be found in /var/log/ during the
    installation, and /var/log/installer/ after the computer has been
    booted into the installed system.


Mini Howto
==========

    1. $ cd d-i/installer

    # Make sure you have automake1.7, automake1.8 and libtool installed
    2. $ dpkg-checkbuilddeps

    # Optional
    3. $ cd build/localudebs; for i in $(find ../.. -name "*.udeb"); \
         do ln -s $i; done

    4. $ fakeroot make build_netboot
