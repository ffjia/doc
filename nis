NIS Setup
=========

* Red Hat specific

    $ cd /var/yp
    # /etc/domainname
    $ domainname <DOMAIN_NAME> # FIXME
    $ /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m
    $ /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -s <MASTERSERVER>
    $ ypserv


* Debian specific

    # For more detail, refer to nis.debian.howto.gz

    # Better add NISDOMAIN in the /etc/hosts file
    $ sudo apt-get install nis

    # Edit /etc/default/nis

        NISSERVER=true
        NISCLIENT=false

    # Edit /etc/ypserv.securenets

        # Restrict to 192.168.1.x
        255.255.255.0       192.168.1.0

    $ sudo invoke-rc.d nis restart
    $ /usr/lib/yp/ypinit -m


Checking NIS status from client
===============================

    $ ypwhich
    $ ypcat passwd
    $ cat /etc/nsswitch.conf

        hosts:  dns [NOTFOUND=return] nis

    $ cat /etc/yp.conf

    $ ypmatch nisuser passwd

    $ getent passwd nisuser


Script transfers map
====================

    #!/bin/sh
    mydomain = ´/bin/domainname´
    cd /var/yp/$mydomain  # the NIS directory
    for map in ´/bin/ls´; do
       /usr/lib/yp/ypxfr $map
    done


NIS theory
==========

    The unit of sharing in NIS is the record, not the file. A record usually
    corresponds to one line in a config file. A master server maintains the
    authoritative copies of system files, which are kept in their original
    locations and formats and are edited with a text editor just as before. A
    server process makes the contents of the files available over the network.
    A server and its clients constitute an NIS "domain."

    Data files are preprocessed into database files by the Berkeley DB hashing
    library to improve the efficiency of lookups. After editing files on the
    master server, you use make to tell NIS to convert them to their hashed
    format.

    If you want users to be able to change their passwords with yppasswd, you
    must run the yppasswdd daemon on the master NIS server. The Linux version
    of this server has been known to crash frequently, so be sure to verify
    that it is still running if the yppasswd command doesn't seem to be
    working.


NIS commands and daemons
=======================

Program    Description
-------    -----------

ypserv     Is the NIS server daemon, started at boot time

ypbind     Is the NIS client daemon, started at boot time

domainname Sets the NIS domain a machine is in (run at boot time)

ypxfr      Downloads current version of a map from master server

ypxfrd     Serves requests from ypxfr (runs on master server)

yppush     Makes slave servers update their versions of a map

makedbm    Builds a hashed map from a flat file

ypmake     Rebuilds hashed maps from flat files that have changed

ypinit     Configures a host as a master or slave server

ypset      Makes ypbind connect to a particular server

ypwhich    Finds out which server the current host is using

yppoll     Finds out what version of a map a server is using

ypcat      Prints the values contained in an NIS map

ypmatch    Prints map entries for a specified key

yppasswd   Changes a password on the NIS master server

ypchfn     Changes GECOS information on the NIS master server

ypchsh     Changes a login shell on NIS master server

yppasswdd  Is the server for yppasswd, ypchsh, and ypchfn

ypupdated  Is the server for updating NIS maps (managed by inetd)
