OpenLDAP hints
==============

* Inside OpenLDAP

    Slapd itself. When you run slapd with both -f and -F specified, it
    will convert all of the slapd.conf and any included files into LDIF.
    Also any of the slap tools will do the same. slapacl will do it in
    2.3.3beta without invoking a lot of extraneous functions; slaptest
    works in the current HEAD and 2.3 candidate.  Then you can issue an
    ldapsearch against the config backend to retrieve the individual
    schema entries, or just copy the files directly out of the cn=config
    file hierarchy.


* About "rootpw" attribute

    If you are using in-directory passwords, then passwords are held in
    userPassword attributes. If you are using rootpw configuration
    option, then rootpw option holds the password. If you are using some
    external password store, the actual passwords are held in that
    external password store. You can, of course, use any combination of
    in-directory, rootpw, and external passwords.

    On the server side the debian "rootdn" has its password assigned in
    the DIT itself using the userPassword attribute like any other user.
    To change it you have to use ldappasswd or similar.


* How to get the search filters

    A simple way to determine the search filters used by any LDAP client
    is to enable connection logging on your directory server. OpenLDAP
    uses log level 256 for this purpose. Another possibility is to use a
    network traffic-monitoring tool such as Ethereal that can decode
    LDAP requests and replies.


* slapadd

    Just a quick note, slapadd does indexing if you have them defined,
    so there is generally no reason to run slapindex after running
    slapadd.  Plus if you have properly configured your DB_CONFIG file,
    it will be faster to slapadd with indexing than to slapadd then
    index.
